# Audio to Guitar Tabs - Design Document

 

## Problem Statement

Convert audio files of any music into playable guitar tablature, focusing on musical arrangement rather than exact transcription.

 
- Extract musical content (melody, chords, rhythm) from any audio

- Arrange that content for guitar playability

- Optimize for human guitarists, not perfect transcription

 

## Architecture Overview

 

### 3-Stage Pipeline

 

```

Audio File → Musical Content → Arrangement Strategy → Guitar Tabs

```

 

## Stage 1: Audio → Musical Content

 

**Input:** Audio waveform 

**Output:** Musical representation

 

```python

{

    melody_line: [(pitch, start_time, duration), ...],

    chord_progression: [(chord, start_time, duration), ...],

    bass_line: [(pitch, start_time, duration), ...],

    rhythm_pattern: timing_info,

    key: "C major",

    tempo: 120

}

```


## Stage 2: Musical Content → Arrangement Strategy

 

**Input:** Musical content 

**Output:** Guitar arrangement plan

 

```python

{

    arrangement_type: "fingerstyle" | "strumming" | "chord_melody",

    melody_approach: "single_notes" | "chord_melody",

    bass_approach: "root_notes" | "alternating_bass",

    rhythm_approach: "strumming_pattern" | "fingerpicking"

}

```
 

**Logic:**

- Analyze tempo, complexity, key

- Choose guitar-friendly arrangement style

- Make creative decisions for playability

 

## Stage 3: Arrangement Strategy → Guitar Tabs

 

**Input:** Arrangement strategy + musical content 

**Output:** Optimized guitar tablature

 

**Optimization Goals:**

- Minimize hand movement

- Prefer open strings and common shapes

- Avoid awkward stretches

- Consider alternate picking patterns

 

## Implementation Phases

 

### Phase 1: MVP

- Use existing audio processing tools

- Simple programmatic arrangement logic

- Basic fingering optimization

- Target: slow songs with clear melody/chords

 

### Phase 2: Enhancement 

- Custom arrangement algorithms

- Multiple difficulty levels

- Guitar-specific techniques (bends, slides)

- Target: broader song variety

 

### Phase 3: Advanced

- ML-based arrangement optimization

- Style-aware generation (classical, jazz, folk)

- Real-time processing

- User feedback integration

 

## Technical Stack
- tentative
 

```python

# Audio Processing

import librosa

from basic_pitch import BASIC_PITCH_MODEL

 

# Music Theory

import music21

import mido

 

# Optimization

import numpy as np

from scipy.optimize import minimize

```

 

## Success Metrics

 

1. **Playability:** Can an average guitarist play the output?

2. **Recognition:** Does it sound like the original song?

3. **Musicality:** Are arrangement choices sensible?

 

## Key Advantages

 

- **Larger song library:** Any audio, not just guitar music

- **Creative control:** Make arrangement decisions for playability 

- **Proven components:** Leverage existing audio processing tools

- **Clear validation:** Easy to test with human guitarists

 

## Example Use Cases

 

- **Classical piano → fingerstyle guitar**

- **Pop vocals → chord/melody arrangement** 

- **Orchestral themes → simplified guitar version**
